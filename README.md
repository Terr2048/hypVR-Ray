# hypVR-Ray
Hyperbolic VR using Raymarching.

Based on the websperience  by Vi Hart, Andrea Hawksley, and Henry Segerman featured over at https://github.com/hawksley/hypVR. This project seeks to improve upon the original by using raymarching as a technique to improve the visible depth of the environment. HypVR-Ray is being worked by Michael Woodard and Henry Segerman and is helped by the work of Jeff Week's Curved Spaces and Mozilla's webVR framework for THREEjs.
